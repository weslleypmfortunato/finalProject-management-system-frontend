<h2>💻 Overview</h2>

<p>Introducing my first full-stack application, the latest employee management application, designed for ease and efficiency. As a recent Bootcamp graduate in web development, I'm proud to present a user-friendly platform to manage most aspects of employee management, timesheet control, and missing items tracking.

This application streamlines employee management by providing easy-to-use features that help you stay on top of your team's absenteeism, payroll, and other important details. You can easily access and manage employee data, such as personal information, job position, and weekly attendance.

The timesheet control system makes 📋 tracking employee worked hours, and monitoring attendance, overtime, and absences simple. This automated system ensures 🎯 accurate timesheet calculations and simplifies the gathering of employee attendance data.

The missing items tracking feature enables you to manage the lack of products per day or range of date to get to know where production should focus to produce and avoid delivery delays, ensuring that the warehouse always has the right goods on hand to keep your business running smoothly 💰 and with no delays.

This application has been built with security measures to protect your data. There are different user levels. The ADMINISTRATOR level can read, create, update and delete all information, while the USER level can only read and add some specific information. There is also a SUPERVISOR level which has more options than the user, but fewer than an administrator. The application utilizes 🔐 encrypted passwords and regularly back up your data to ensure that it is always safe and accessible where you are.

This user-friendly interface makes your application easy to navigate, even for those with little or no technical experience. And if you ever run into any issues, I am always available to help.

The employee management application provides a comprehensive solution to manage employee data, timesheet control, and inventory tracking in one easy-to-use platform. My application is designed to make your employee management processes more efficient and streamlined and accurate no matter the size of your business.

<h2> 👨 About the developer</h2>

<p>I am a passionate animal lover with a keen interest in Canadian weather. After spending 13 years working for Foxconn manufacturing Apple products, where I gained valuable experience in project management and quality reliability testing in the electronics sector, I decided to take on a new challenge by moving to Canada and starting a new career in web development.

I am currently pursuing my dream of becoming a proficient web developer by attending college and learning everything from scratch. Being in Victoria, BC, allows me to explore my love for nature by hiking and discovering new places in my spare time.

I am a firm believer in continuous improvement and pay close attention to every detail, no matter how small, to ensure the final product is of the highest quality. I am excited to see where my newfound skills and experiences will take me, and I am eager to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way..</p>
